The Government tells us to shelter in place.  But what if you get infected, and your fridge is empty?<br>
<br>
If you don’t have someone able to take care of you, the system we have says sin or starve. And if you have kids, who’s going to feed them?
<br>
Hunger will force you to go to the store, even if you're sick, coughing, infecting everybody.

Online home delivery is great for people who can use it, but not everybody can.<br><br>
A sizeable number of people don’t have internet access, don’t have bank accounts, and/or rely on paper money for everything.<br><br>
A lot of people also rely on EBT/SNAP/Food stamps. Can’t get delivery with those either.<br><br>
Whether undocumented, low-income, disabled, or just old-fashioned, COVID-19 DOESN’T CARE.<br><br>
Save a life by slowing the spread. If you’re sick, use us. If you’re healthy, give sick people a reason to stay home by volunteering.<br><br>
